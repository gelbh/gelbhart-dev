# Pac-Man Game Sound Effects Implementation

## Overview
Implemented authentic Pac-Man arcade sound effects with proper timing and game state integration.

## Sound Files Added
All sound files are located in `app/assets/audio/pacman-game/`:
- `pacman_beginning.wav` - Intro music that plays when game starts
- `pacman_chomp.wav` - Continuous "wakawaka" sound while moving and eating dots
- `pacman_death.wav` - Death sound when Pac-Man is caught by a ghost
- `pacman_eatfruit.wav` - Sound when eating power pellets
- `pacman_eatghost.wav` - Sound when eating a frightened ghost
- `pacman_extrapac.wav` - Sound when earning an extra life at 10,000 points
- `pacman_intermission.wav` - Victory music when all dots are collected

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Intro Music Wait System
**Location**: `startGame()` method in `pacman-game_controller.js`

**Implementation**:
- Added `isStarting` flag to track when game is waiting for intro music
- When a movement key is first pressed, the game:
  1. Plays the beginning music (`pacman_beginning.wav`)
  2. Sets up the game (shows HUD, generates dots/ghosts)
  3. **WAITS** for the intro music to finish before allowing gameplay
  4. Uses event listener on audio's `ended` event to detect completion
  5. Includes 5-second timeout fallback in case event doesn't fire
- Movement is blocked during intro music phase
- Once music ends, gameplay starts automatically and Pac-Man begins moving

**Code Flow**:
```javascript
User presses WASD/Arrow → 
  Game enters "starting" phase → 
    Intro music plays → 
      Game setup completes → 
        Music ends → 
          Gameplay begins with movement enabled
```

### 2. Sound Effect Triggers

#### Beginning Sound
- **Trigger**: First movement key press (WASD or arrow keys)
- **Behavior**: Plays once, blocks gameplay until finished
- **Duration**: ~4.6 seconds

#### Chomp Sound
- **Trigger**: Continuous while Pac-Man is moving
- **Behavior**: Looping audio that plays when velocity is non-zero
- **Location**: `gameLoop()` method
- **Management**:
  ```javascript
  if (velocity !== 0) {
    startChompSound() // Starts if not already playing
  } else {
    stopChompSound() // Stops when not moving
  }
  ```

#### Power Pellet Sound
- **Trigger**: When eating a power pellet (large dot)
- **Sound**: `pacman_eatfruit.wav`
- **Location**: `checkDotCollisions()` when `dot.isPowerPellet === true`

#### Eat Ghost Sound
- **Trigger**: When eating a frightened ghost
- **Points**: +200
- **Location**: `checkGhostCollisions()` when ghost is frightened

#### Death Sound
- **Trigger**: When Pac-Man collides with a non-frightened ghost
- **Behavior**: Plays once, stops all other sounds
- **Location**: `loseLife()` method
- **Side Effects**: Stops chomp sound, triggers death animation

#### Extra Life Sound
- **Trigger**: When score reaches 10,000 points
- **Behavior**: Plays once (tracked by `extraLifeAwarded` flag)
- **Location**: `updateHUD()` method
- **Result**: Lives incremented by 1

#### Victory Sound
- **Trigger**: When all dots are collected
- **Sound**: `pacman_intermission.wav` (longer celebratory music)
- **Location**: `winGame()` method
- **Behavior**: Stops all other sounds first, then plays

### 3. Sound System Architecture

#### Initialization
```javascript
initializeSoundSystem() {
  // Creates Audio objects for each sound
  // Sets volume to 40% (not too loud)
  // Enables preloading for instant playback
  // Configures chomp to loop
}
```

#### Helper Methods
- `playSound(soundName, restart)` - Play a specific sound
- `stopSound(soundName)` - Stop a specific sound
- `stopAllSounds()` - Emergency stop for all audio
- `startChompSound()` - Begin continuous chomp
- `stopChompSound()` - End continuous chomp

#### Asset Path Handling
Supports both development and production environments:
```javascript
const getAudioPath = (filename) => {
  // Production: Use digested asset path from manifest
  if (this.assetPaths[`pacman-game/${filename}`]) {
    return `/assets/${this.assetPaths[key]}`
  }
  // Development: Use direct path
  return `/assets/pacman-game/${filename}`
}
```

### 4. Game State Integration

#### Flags Added
- `isStarting`: Prevents gameplay until intro music finishes
- `chompPlaying`: Tracks if chomp sound is currently active
- `soundsEnabled`: Global sound system state

#### State Transitions
1. **Idle → Starting**
   - Intro music plays
   - Movement blocked
   - Game elements initialized

2. **Starting → Active**
   - Intro music finishes
   - Movement enabled
   - Chomp sound can start

3. **Active → Dying**
   - All sounds stop
   - Death sound plays
   - Movement blocked

4. **Dying → Active (Respawn)**
   - Countdown shown
   - Movement resumes in random direction
   - Chomp sound restarts if moving

5. **Active → Game Over**
   - All sounds stop
   - Modal shown
   - Game can be restarted

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Intro music plays when first key pressed
- [x] Game waits for intro music to finish
- [x] Chomp sound plays continuously while moving
- [x] Chomp sound stops when stationary
- [x] Power pellet sound plays when eating large dots
- [x] Ghost eat sound plays when eating frightened ghosts
- [x] Death sound plays when caught by ghost
- [x] Extra life sound plays at 10,000 points
- [x] Victory music plays when all dots collected
- [x] All sounds stop when game ends
- [x] Sound system handles browser autoplay restrictions gracefully

## Browser Compatibility Notes

### Autoplay Restrictions
Modern browsers restrict autoplay of audio. The implementation handles this by:
1. Using `.catch()` on all `.play()` calls to silently handle rejections
2. Only playing sounds after user interaction (keyboard input)
3. Logging warnings to console for debugging without breaking functionality

### Audio Format
Using `.wav` format for maximum compatibility:
- Supported by all major browsers
- No codec issues
- Consistent playback timing
- Small file sizes (compressed)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Preloading**: All sounds preloaded at controller connect
2. **Volume Control**: Set to 40% to avoid being too loud
3. **Loop Efficiency**: Chomp uses native audio loop instead of repeated play calls
4. **Conditional Playback**: Sounds only play when needed (e.g., chomp only when moving)
5. **Memory Management**: Audio objects reused, not recreated

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add siren sound for when ghosts are chasing
- [ ] Add "ready" sound before game starts
- [ ] Add sound for entering tunnels (screen edges)
- [ ] Volume control slider in UI
- [ ] Mute/unmute button
- [ ] Different music for different levels
- [ ] Sound for collecting fruit bonus items
- [ ] Combo sounds for eating multiple ghosts quickly

## Assets Manifest Configuration

Ensure `config/initializers/assets.rb` includes:
```ruby
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app/assets/audio')
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w[
  pacman-game/pacman_beginning.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_chomp.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_death.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_eatfruit.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_eatghost.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_extrapac.wav
  pacman-game/pacman_intermission.wav
]
```

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. Run `rails assets:precompile` to generate digested audio asset paths
2. Ensure asset manifest is passed to Stimulus controller
3. Verify audio files are served with correct MIME types
4. Check browser console for any audio loading errors
5. Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
