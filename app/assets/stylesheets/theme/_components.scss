//
// Theme Components
// --------------------------------------------------
//
// Components are organized by category following atomic design principles:
//
//   base/        - Foundation/base styles (typography, code, tables)
//   forms/       - Form-related components (forms, buttons, social buttons)
//   navigation/  - Navigation components (nav, navbar, breadcrumb, pagination)
//   layout/      - Container/layout components (card, list-group, accordion)
//   feedback/    - User feedback components (alert, toasts, modal, popover, offcanvas)
//   media/       - Media-related components (carousel, gallery, audio, parallax, comparison)
//   ui/          - UI elements (badge, progress, steps, placeholders, dropdown)
//
// Import order is maintained to preserve CSS cascade and dependencies.
